# SlackBot
**The simplest way to create Slack bots**

## Installation

```
go get github.com/neilco/slackbot
```

## Getting Started

Create a new Slack Incoming WebHook integration and copy the `Token`.

```
package main

import (
	"github.com/neilco/slackbot"
)

func main() {
	bot := slack.NewBot("<Slack Team name>", "<Slack Integration Token>")
	bot.PublishText("Hello World")
}
```

### Changing the name & icon of the bot on the fly

```
bot.Name = "octobot"
bot.IconURL = "http://example.com/ocotbot.png"
```

### Sending a message to a specific channel

```
message := NewMessage("#development", false)
message.Text = "Hello Developers"

bot.Publish(message)
```

### Sending an auto-expanding hyperlinked message


```
message := NewMessage("#development", true)
message.Text = "Check out <this Go package|http://github.com/neilco/SlackBot>!"

bot.Publish(message)
```

For details on how you can configure the message posted to Slack, see the [`Message`](https://github.com/neilco/SlackBot/blob/master/slackbot.go#L24) type in the source.
